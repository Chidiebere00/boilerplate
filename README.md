2. 1940s- Alan Turning use his Bombe Machine to break german Engima  machine

5. 1960s- MIT J.C.R Licklider popularized the idea of "intergalactic Network"
## Early Research and Development
6. 1960s- The U.S goverment separates Military research from the military and create ARPANET or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network

7. 1960s- ARPANET was created as the US GOvernment neededa speedy and efficient way too commmunicate accross the country.

11. 1970s- Email is invented by Ray Tomlinson 

12. 1980s- Various researchers in many universities continue to research computer connections, and the technology become more known to the public

13. 1980s- ARPANET begin the assembly of networks which lead to the modern day internet

14. 1990- Tim Berners-Lee invents the World WIde Web, allowing people to access websites and hyperlinks

15. 1990s- Netscape develops the first graphical browser that ran on popular computers
