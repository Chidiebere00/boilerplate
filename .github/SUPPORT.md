#BEGINNER TUTORIAL ON USING GIT TO COLLABORATE EFFECTIVELY



**GIT**: Git is a free and open source distributed code management and version control system that is distributed under
the GNU General Public License version 2. In addition to software version control, Git is used for other applications 
including configuration management and content management.
Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, developed and released Git in 2005. The project was originally undertaken because
available open source version control systems at that time weren't up to up to the requirements of Linux kernel 
development. For one thing, version control for such a large-scale collaborative effort requires better performance than
available systems were capable of -- three seconds to apply a patch, for example, versus 30. In addition to its 
superior performance, Git provides support for a distributed workflow and safeguards against corruption.

_**Here are some definitions for clarification on the meaning of Git above if you are not familiar with some of the terms:**_

**Control System**: This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used 
to store code due to the other features it provides.

**Version Control System**: The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can
add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have 
happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.

**Distributed Version Control System**: Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which
is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full 
copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is 
present in every developer’s computer.

So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git
revolve is the hub www.GitHub.com where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.
(YOU MUST CREATE AN ACCOUNT WITH GITHUB WITH YOUR EMAIL AND A PASSWORD)

Let's explore some of the terminology in Github in order to grasp a clearer picture of the Hub.

**Repository**: A repository is  location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its 
own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL.
(AFTER YOU HAVE CREATED YOUR ACCOUNT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE AND ACCESS REPOSITORIES)
AT THE RIGHT TOP CORNER OF THE WEB PAGE YOU WILL SEE AN ADDITION SIGN DISPLAYED "+", CLICK ON IT TO ADD A REPOSITORY.

**Clone**: The "clone" command downloads an existing Git repository to your local computer.
You will then have a full-blown, local version of that Git repo and can start working on the project. That remote 
repository's URL is then later referred to as the "origin".
(ONCE YOU ARE IN A REPOSITORY YOU WILL SEE THE GREEN CLONE/DOWNLOAD BUTTON)

**Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file,
except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record
of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
(COMMITS NEED TO BE MADE IN ORDER TO PUSH OR PULL, ALWAYS COMMIT AFTER YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES!)

**Push**: Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.
For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.
